# Autonomous-Microgrid-Forecasting
This repository was used to run distributed wind-hybrid microgrid simulations that incorporate advanced wind controls, 
forecasting, and a autonomous microgrid system controller. Results from this study can be found in the paper: 
Distributed Wind-Hybrid Microgrids With Autonomous Controls and Forecasting, which is being published. The main simulation file is 
Auto_microgrid_forecasting.slx
